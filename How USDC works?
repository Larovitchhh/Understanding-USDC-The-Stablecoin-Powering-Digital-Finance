USDC is an ERC-20 token built primarily on the Ethereum blockchain, though it also operates on other networks like Solana, Algorand, and Polygon to enhance scalability and reduce transaction costs. Each USDC token is backed by a corresponding U.S. dollar or dollar-equivalent asset, such as U.S. Treasury bonds, held in reserve by regulated financial institutions. This ensures that USDC can be redeemed for $1 at any time, providing users with confidence in its value stability.The reserves are audited monthly by reputable accounting firms, with reports publicly available to ensure transparency. For example, as of recent data, USDCâ€™s circulating supply exceeds 30 billion tokens, with reserves comprising cash, cash equivalents, and short-term U.S. Treasuries held at institutions like BlackRock and BNY Mellon.
