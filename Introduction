USD Coin (USDC) is a leading stablecoin in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar. Launched in 2018 by Circle and Coinbase through the Centre Consortium, USDC has become a cornerstone of decentralized finance (DeFi), cross-border payments, and digital asset trading. As a fully collateralized digital asset, USDC bridges the gap between traditional finance and blockchain technology, offering stability in a volatile crypto market.
