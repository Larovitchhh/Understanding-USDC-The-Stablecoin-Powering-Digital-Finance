USDC competes with stablecoins like Tether (USDT), Dai, and Binance USD (BUSD). Compared to USDT, USDC is often viewed as more transparent due to its regular audits and U.S.-based regulation. Dai, a decentralized stablecoin, relies on crypto collateral and smart contracts, making it less centralized but potentially less stable. BUSD, while similar to USDC, has faced regulatory challenges, reducing its market share.
